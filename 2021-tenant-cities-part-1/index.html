      <p>When DaJuan Davis learned that his application for rent relief was denied, exposing him and his son to another potential eviction, he felt<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>“crushed.”</p>


    <!-- Name, location, type -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>“I felt so dejected. It took a lot of energy from me,” said Davis, 45, in a January interview. The sometime commercial driver and convenience store worker, now employed by McDonald’s, sat on his living room couch, while his 13-year-old son attended virtual school in an adjacent<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>bedroom.</p>


    <!-- Name, location, type -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>He said he’s rented from Monroeville-based Arbors Management for 11 years. He’d weathered eviction filings, which followed a change of employment and gap in pay, in<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>2019.</p>


    <!-- Name, location, type -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>His best hope of avoiding another eviction filing, following his July 8 loss of a job, had seemed to be Pennsylvania’s CARES Rent Relief Program. On July 10, he and the property manager filled out forms seeking six months of state help paying the $610-a-month rent for his Penn Hills<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>apartment.</p>

      <p>But later that month, he was denied relief, as were some 30,000 other Pennsylvanians. He’s not certain why. Now, Davis faces an eviction hearing that could occur in April. If ejected, his son can move in with the son’s mother. But the father? “What am I supposed to do?” he asked. “Am I supposed to hide under my<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>couch?”</p>

      <p>Last year the state’s rent relief program approved just over 1/3 of applications that came in by its deadline of Nov. 4. The state spent just $54 million of the $150 million it allocated for tenants and their landlords, according to the Pennsylvania Housing Finance Agency [PHFA], which coordinated the program. The remainder <a target="_blank" href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2020/12/rent-relief-pennsylvania-rrp-cares-act-eviction-mortgage-budget-doc/">went instead to the Department of Corrections</a>, as Republican legislators and Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf <a target="_blank" href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2020/11/pennsylvania-budget-coronavirus-relief-aid-restaurants-providers/">balanced the state’s pandemic-walloped<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>budget</a>.</p>

      <p>PHFA delegated distribution of the funds to counties. Allegheny County managed to dish out $14.7 million in rent relief, but only tapped the state program for around 5% of that. Instead, in late October, the county largely ditched the state’s rules and funds, using its own federal allocation.

State officials said they struggled to get funds to those in need for a number of reasons, some driven by federal rules and others added at the state level. The program included a requirement that tenants be 30 days in arrears and complete extensive paperwork. In most of the state, landlords had to agree to accept the maximum $750 monthly cap on assistance as full payment of rent, and some were reluctant to write off any<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>balance.</p>

      <p>A bill that passed the state Senate Wednesday would have the state Department of Human Services, rather than PHFA, administer the next round of rent relief. It would compel DHS to steer funds to counties by April 1.

      <p>In 2019, landlords filed 13,105 eviction cases. Last year, pandemic-driven moratoriums and curbs on evictions pushed that number down to 5,219. This year, even as hearings and ejections are on pause, landlord eviction filings are on the<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>rise.</p>

      <p><h2>Evictions not halted</h2></p>

    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>In March, the state put a halt to virtually all eviction activity. And shortly after state bans expired on Aug. 31, the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/eviction-moratoria-order-faqs.pdf">CDC put a stop</a> to most evictions solely for nonpayment of rent. In the early hours of Joe Biden’s presidency, that order was <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s0121-eviction-moratorium.html">extended to March<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>31</a>.</p>


    <!-- Name, location, type -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>The CDC allows eviction for &quot;criminal activity while on the premises,&quot; threatening health or safety of other residents, damaging property, and violating building codes or lease<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>terms.</p>


    <!-- Name, location, type -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>That’s why eviction filings have continued, with January on pace to produce nearly 400 landlord/tenant cases in Allegheny County, up from 288 in December. Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas Judge Kim Berkeley Clark has <a target="_blank" href="https://www.alleghenycourts.us/downloads/administration/010721_Amended_Emergency_Operations_Order.pdf">repeatedly postponed hearings</a> on the cases, but hundreds of cases await the expiration of her<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>orders.</p>

      <p>Davis’ case is now among them. He bounced between jobs last year, resulting in short periods without pay, which snowballed. He fell $3,065 behind on rent by June, according to a ledger Arbors sent him in<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>December.</p>


    <!-- Name, location, type -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>When his unemployment came through, he paid $3,400, and he later forked over another $1,269. But with state aid denied, and Arbors adding late fees, he never caught<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>up.</p>

      <p>A Notice to Vacate which Arbors sent to Davis in mid-December cites the debt, his guilty pleas to summary offenses from a July incident at Forbes Regional Hospital, a barbecuing incident that left a charcoal stain on the front stairs, and four instances of excessive<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>noise.</p>

      <p>“We just woke up early this morning, and we were just having a numerous-subject [conversation],” Davis said. “And one of the conversations was about resentment, and about what others do to you, and like, how do you handle<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>that.”</p>
