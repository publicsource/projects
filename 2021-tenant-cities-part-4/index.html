    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>Kids dashed and footballs flew around the sunny courtyard of Hi View Gardens as a dozen tenants of the McKeesport apartment complex gathered by concrete steps to challenge a mysteriously named landlord with resources they could only guess<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>at.</p>


    <!-- Name, location, type -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>For three years, they’d watched their 117-apartment community deteriorate and had complained individually to managers hired to run Hi View by a landlord referred to on property records as McKeesport Urban Holdings 2<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>LLC.</p>


    <!-- Name, location, type -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>They’d placed buckets below leaky roofs and<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>plumbing.</p>


    <!-- Name, location, type -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>They’d fired up stoves when the radiators<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>failed.</p>


    <!-- Name, location, type -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>They’d endured roaches and<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>rodents.</p>


    <!-- Name, location, type -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>They’d called 911 when harassed, assaulted or shot at by<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>intruders.</p>


    <!-- Name, location, type -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>Finally, on May 12, the tenants – mostly Black or Brown women – were getting<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>organized.</p>


    <!-- Name, location, type -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>“Get us our maintenance people. Give us somebody in our office who knows what they’re doing. And get our apartments together,” tenant leader Tanya Brown summarized, as they discussed the petition they planned to circulate and present to the management company and<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>landlord.</p>

    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>That day, they founded the Hi View Gardens Tenant Council, represented by attorneys at the Community Justice Project, a nonprofit legal assistance firm. They signed the petition demanding that unnamed owners make Hi View a “safe, affordable and welcoming place to live,” rather than one where residents were treated “with a lack of respect and<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>dignity.”</p>


    <!-- Name, location, type -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>The tenants didn’t know it then, but responsibility for their housing ultimately rests with the nation’s <a target="_blank" href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/lbr/current/">seventh-largest commercial bank</a>, one with nearly half a trillion dollars in assets that has taken a deep interest in affordable<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>housing.</p>


    <!-- Name, location, type -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>In May 2018, PNC Bank bought McKeesport Urban Holdings 2 and thus Hi View. It simultaneously bought McKeesport Urban Holdings 1, which owns the 11-story Midtown Plaza, two blocks from Hi<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>View.</p>


    <!-- Name, location, type -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>The Pittsburgh area “is home for PNC, and the idea of preserving existing affordable housing for the residents of Pittsburgh was very appealing,” said Todd Crow, the bank&#8217;s executive vice president in charge of tax credit solutions, a department that includes affordable housing investments. “Basically, we saw the potential that this property could be lost as affordable rental housing,” he said. But if PNC became the owner, it could instead help current residents to<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>stay.</p>

      <p>After PNC bought property in McKeesport, the bank contacted local officials “right off the bat,” said the city’s Community Development Director A.J. Tedesco<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>Jr.</p>


    <!-- Name, location, type -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>“They said, ‘We&#8217;re going to work with you, we&#8217;re going to change the culture of those buildings and we&#8217;re going to make them nice and do all this,’” Tedesco said in a June<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>interview.</p>

    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>In 2019 and 2020, though, health code violations and 911 calls at Hi View and Midtown jumped nearly 50% compared to the prior two years, driving some of the nearly 200 households to search — often in vain — for other housing<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>options.</p>


    <!-- Name, location, type -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->

      <p>As it typically does when it finds a violation, the department demanded that the owner listed in property records — in this case McKeesport Urban Holdings 2 — repair the problems. It sent the report to the Hi View office staffed by Maine-based Preservation Management Inc. [PMI], which handles day-to-day operations of that complex and Midtown Plaza. There is no sign in the documents that the Health Department knew of PNC’s ownership or directly alerted the bank to the<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>violations.</p>

      <p>Combined, Hi View and Midtown amount to around 5% of McKeesport’s 4,400 rental units. From 2017 through 2019, they typically accounted for around 10% of that city&#8217;s health code violations. Last year, the 143 housing health code violations found in Hi View and Midtown accounted for 42% of such violations logged by the county in that<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>city.</p>

      <p>Hi View and Midtown both stem from land sales by the Redevelopment Authority of the City of McKeesport to private developers, the first in 1969, the second in 1974. It was a time when federal housing policy was moving away from public ownership of affordable apartments and <a href="https://nlihc.org/sites/default/files/Sec1.03_Historical-Overview_2015.pdf">toward the model</a> known as Section<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>8.</p>

      <p>Section 8 vouchers allow low-income tenants — the <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/housing/chart-book-employment-and-earnings-for-households-receiving-federal-rental">vast majority of whom</a> are elderly, disabled or working low-wage jobs —  to pay 30% of their incomes as rent, with the federal government covering the<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>balance.</p>

      <p>From 1974 to 1983, the federal government gave landlords and developers <a href="https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/RL32284.html">Section 8 subsidies to build or renovate housing</a>, as long as they pledged to rent units to low-income families for 40 years and passed periodic inspections by the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development [HUD]. The federal government replaced that program <a href="https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/publication/98758/lithc_how_it_works_and_who_it_serves_final_2.pdf">in 1986</a> with the low-income housing tax credit program, which allows institutions to invest in affordable housing in return for reduced tax<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>bills.</p>

      <p>In its most recent <a href="https://www.occ.gov/static/cra/craeval/apr19/1316.pdf">Community Reinvestment Act report</a>, released in 2018, PNC indicated that it had made 102 investments totaling $780.8 million in development backed by tax credits. Through various partnerships, it owns affordable housing properties in around 30 communities<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>nationwide.</p>


    <!-- Name, location, type -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>Hi View and Midtown were backed by Section 8 subsidies and were owned until 2018 by a New York-based businessman named Israel Gross. PNC learned that the federal Section 8 contracts that control rents at those properties were set to expire in<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>2021.</p>


    <!-- Name, location, type -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>“Our concern was that a competing buyer could step in, buy these properties and choose not to extend the rental assistance contract in order to raise rents, likely displacing residents,” said Crow. He said the bank extended an existing contract with HUD, governing the affordability of some of the units, by 10<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>years.</p>

      <p>Responsibility for day-to-day operations at the properties was assigned to Maine-based PMI, which runs affordable, government-subsidized apartments in 20 states, including 18 sites in<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>Pennsylvania.</p>


    <!-- Name, location, type -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>In 2019, PNC and a development team led by Maine-based Evergreen Partners and including PMI applied through the Pennsylvania Housing Finance Agency for $11.4 million in low-income housing tax credits. They planned to use the credits in an $18 million effort to renovate both the site and all apartments and preserve the affordability of Hi View. Amid intense competition for credits, PHFA denied the<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>application.</p>


    <!-- Name, location, type -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>PNC had planned to reapply for tax credits for Hi View this year and for Midtown next year, according to Crow. A <a href="https://pittsburgh.cbslocal.com/2020/05/24/mckeesport-fire-hospitalized/">May 2020 fire</a>, though, left one of the Hi View buildings uninhabitable and may affect that timetable. He said the bank is in talks with nonprofit developers about renovating both Hi View and Midtown, while keeping them affordable for the long<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>term.</p>

      <p>It’s not uncommon for a company buying an affordable apartment complex to take a year or two — sometimes three — to line up financing and fix it up, said Denise Muha, executive director of the <a href="https://hudnlha.com/">National Leased Housing Association</a>, which represents companies involved in the affordable rental<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>sector.</p>


    <!-- Name, location, type -->

    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>She said that she has repeatedly asked for repairs, and a PMI manager made multiple excuses: that a new door had been ordered, that maintenance was too short-staffed to replace it, and at one point that the manager “doesn&#8217;t have money for the<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>door.”</p>

      <p>On Jan. 29, according to McKeesport records, building inspectors responding to an anonymous tip found that fire alarm systems weren&#8217;t working in any of Hi View&#8217;s buildings and ordered that they be fixed “immediately.” Inspectors confirmed that the system was working on Feb.<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>16.</p>
