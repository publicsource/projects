      <p>Richard Reiter bought one of those houses, featuring a shady porch and a turret, for $28,000 in 1980. His total property tax bill is under $900. “It’s good,” he said. “It could be<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>lower.”</p>


    <!-- Subhed -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>The house two doors down is around 30% larger — and gets a tax bill that’s five times higher. Reiter shrugged that off. “They paid a lot more for the house,” he<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>noted.</p>


    <!-- Subhed -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>Such chasms between tax bills result from the combination of rapidly rising housing prices, related assessment appeals and largely frozen valuations of houses that have not changed<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>hands.</p>


    <!-- Subhed -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>The county has, for a decade, used assessments of property values that it assigned in 2012 as the basis for the taxes levied on many homes and commercial<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>buildings.</p>


    <!-- Subhed -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>Properties that are sold, however, are often the subjects of assessment appeals filed by school districts or municipalities seeking more revenue. As housing markets have heated up in certain neighborhoods, some new buyers have been the subjects of appeals and have seen their assessments – and thus their tax bills –<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>soar.</p>


    <!-- Subhed -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>The county’s decision not to regularly reassess property has allowed assessment divides to worsen, said Pittsburgh Controller Michael<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>Lamb.</p>


    <!-- Subhed -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>“The more you stand still, the more unfair it gets,” he said. Without regular reevaluations of properties, “every 10 years or so, you get into this situation where you’ve got this horrible, unfair system of<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>taxation.”</p>

    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>To be equitable, property taxes should be closely tied to the values of the taxed land and buildings. Pennsylvania’s constitution allows tax breaks for people based on age, disability, poverty, owner occupancy and length of residence, but broadly requires that those abatements, and the taxes themselves, be<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>“uniform.”</p>


    <!-- Subhed -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>It’s difficult, though, to envision a perfect way of taxing property with perfect<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>uniformity.</p>


    <!-- Subhed -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>“The government and we as citizens, we don’t actually know what property is worth,” said Christopher Berry, a University of Chicago professor and director of the Center for Municipal Finance. “Most people’s houses don’t sell every year or maybe not even every decade. So at any point in time, there’s a lot of uncertainty about what that house would be worth if it were to be<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>sold.”</p>


    <!-- Subhed -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>State law assigns counties the difficult job of assessing and taxing property. Traditionally, that has been done by periodically identifying, for each property, nearby “comparables” that were recently purchased in fair-market transactions. The property’s assessment is then based on those sale prices. While assessors in the past were expected to examine each home, some jurisdictions in recent years have turned to computer-assisted mass appraisal to improve efficiency. Philadelphia is in the process of implementing computer-assisted regular<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>reassessments.</p>


    <!-- Subhed -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>The state gives counties another labor-saving option: They can pick a “base year” at which values will be set indefinitely, and then consider subsequent sale prices as indicators of changes in the worth of<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>properties.</p>


    <!-- Subhed -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>Courts ordered Allegheny County to reevaluate the values of land and buildings in 2001, 2005 and 2012. Since then, County Executive Rich Fitzgerald has made 2012 the county’s base year, preserving assessments at levels set then, unless the owner, a municipality or school district files an<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>appeal.</p>


    <!-- Subhed -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>Fitzgerald, whose third and final term runs through next year, declined an interview request made through county spokeswoman Amie<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>Downs.</p>

    <!-- Subhed -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>School districts and some municipalities watch for property sales that are in excess of assessed values, and then appeal to the county’s Property Assessment Appeals &amp; Review Board. That panel then decides whether to change the<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>values.</p>


    <!-- Subhed -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>Pittsburgh City Council in 2016 passed a resolution that largely put a halt to the city’s appeals. The school district, though, has filed a total of nearly 1,900 appeals on assessments of residential properties from 2017 through 2021, according to county data retrieved from the Western Pennsylvania Regional Data<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>Center.</p>


    <!-- Subhed -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>Each appeal involves time and expense, noted attorney M. Janet Burkardt, who works on the district’s filings with her law partner, Pittsburgh Public Schools Solicitor Ira Weiss. The firm also serves as solicitor for five other districts in Allegheny<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>County.</p>


    <!-- Subhed -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>“In order to make the appeal worthwhile, there has to be more than a 30% difference between the sale price and the assessed value,” said Burkardt. She said her firm typically does not appeal the values of properties sold for less than<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>$200,000.</p>


    <!-- Subhed -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>The district’s appeals sometimes follow sales by well over a year, creating some odd tax imbalances on Pittsburgh<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>streets.</p>

    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>A South Side Slopes house, for instance, sold for $300,000 in 2015. A school district appeal filed in 2017 more than doubled the assessment and tax<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>bill.</p>


    <!-- Subhed -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>Last year, the larger house next door sold for $575,000. As yet there has been no appeal<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>filed.</p>


    <!-- Subhed -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>For now, a house that sold for nearly double its neighbor’s price incurs half the tax<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>bill.</p>


    <!-- Subhed -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>When appeals are successful, the appeals board assigns a new assessment, based largely on the sale price. The board applies a discount, purportedly calculated to bring the new tax bill closer in line with properties whose assessments are still at 2012 levels. That process is the subject of a lawsuit in the Court of Common Pleas in which plaintiffs claim that the county is miscalculating changes in the property market, and that the discount should be much<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>steeper.</p>

      <p>If the county decided to reassess, it would need to assign new tax values to the roughly 580,000 parcels within its boundaries. But neither the county, nor its municipalities or districts, would be allowed to pocket huge increases in<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>revenue.</p>


    <!-- Subhed -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>State and county laws bar governments from using reassessments to reap windfall increases in their total property tax collections. As a result, if a reassessment boosted assessments, tax rates would have to come down to prevent a surge in collections. With assessments rising but rates falling, some tax bills would go up, while others would come<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>down.</p>

      <p>The Burns house is less than half the size of the Felix house and cost half as much. Burns’ tax bill is one-tenth of Felix’s — so<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>far.</p>

      <p>His purchase price was six times the county’s assessment, potentially making it a target for a school district<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>appeal.</p>

    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>Burns said he hadn’t thought much about the possibility of an assessment appeal. If an appeal resulted in a big jump in his tax bill, “it wouldn’t be great. If that goes up six times, that wouldn’t be ideal. We would be able to afford it, but we would have to cut some other things<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>out.”</p>

    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>A reassessment of every property, if it pushed assessments close to market values, could have an even more dramatic effect on the tax bills of Burns’ neighbors. Their houses have been in their families for decades and have even lower<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>assessments.</p>

      <p>“I don’t understand the logic” of wildly different property assessments, said Burns, when told of his neighbors’ tax bills. “I’d like to know that there was more uniformity to the<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>process.”</p>


    <!-- Subhed -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>Controller Lamb predicted that the lack of uniformity will eventually put the county back in<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>court.</p>

    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>“There’s going to be a [legal] challenge to the fairness of assessments,“ he predicted. That will spur another reassessment, and the longer the delay, the bigger the resulting changes will<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>be.</p>

    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>Randall Walsh, a University of Pittsburgh economics professor and housing expert, said other states, like Colorado, adjust assessments annually or biennially, based on neighborhood-level property sales data. Allegheny County’s decision to retain decade-old values results in “fundamentally inequitable” variations in<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>taxes.</p>


    <!-- Subhed -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>“Politics are part of why we don’t do things right, because politicians are afraid of the backlash that happens when you see large adjustments in property tax rates,” said Walsh. By failing to reassess for a decade, he added, the county “is locking in that sort of unhappiness and unease for down the road when we have to have another big adjustment because we haven’t been keeping<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>up.”</p>


    <!-- Subhed -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>In neighborhoods like Lawrenceville, where longtime homeowners live next to better-off newcomers, a reassessment could be “heartbreaking“ in its effects on lower-income residents, Lamb said. “So how do you protect those<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>people?”</p>


    <!-- Subhed -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>He said state legislators could change the law and allow counties to limit the amount that a given person&#8217;s tax bill could rise due to<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>reassessment.</p>

      <p>“We‘ve got a horrendously unfair system of taxation,” he said, “and when we try to fix it, we’re going to be hurting the people who least can afford getting<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>hurt.”</p>
