      <p>When the <a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/11VWopBk3jpFMLIFGJfocoC1a5Zst2QJH/view?usp=sharing">Allegheny County Health Department inspector</a> arrived at the apartment Beatrice Román shared with her two sons, the indoor temperature was 62.9 degrees. The baseboard heater wasn’t operating, and space heaters weren’t cutting it. “Repair or replace the heating system,” the inspector wrote, characterizing the situation, in red type, as an<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>“EMERGENCY.”</p>


    <!-- Name, location, type -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>The inspector also reported a leak in the ceiling, peeling or bubbling paint and missing ceiling tiles, a trash-strewn common laundry room and “a big hole in the wall next to apartment 404 along the hallway that may permit rodent entry into the<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>unit.”</p>

      <p>That inspection, which occurred after Román complained to Hi View management and then contacted the Health Department, marked the beginning of six months of tension between the Puerto Rico native and management company Preservation Management Inc. PMI, which did not respond to requests for comment, runs Hi View and nearby Midtown Plaza. PNC bought those properties, totaling around 200 apartments, in 2018 as part of that institution’s bid to preserve affordable<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>housing.</p>

    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>Román, 37, is a high school graduate who said she left Puerto Rico because she felt unsafe, and then departed New Jersey because the cost of living was too high. She told parts of her story to WESA and PublicSource in English and parts through translator and paralegal Rafael Bullones, of the Community Justice Project, a nonprofit law office representing her and the new Hi View Gardens Tenant<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>Council.</p>

      <p>On the recommendation of a family member, Román moved to Hi View in 2019 with sons Jerremy, now 17, and Kelvyn, 4. They rely on Supplemental Security Income and the federal rent subsidy that covers part of the rent for many low-income tenants who live in Hi<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>View.</p>


    <!-- Name, location, type -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>An immaculate housekeeper, Román moves through a soundscape of Spanish-language TV, a burbling fish tank, the skittering feet of their dog, Daisy, and Kelvyn’s high-pitched trilling. The 4-year-old is quick to smile, take someone’s hand, climb on to a lap or give a hug but doesn’t yet say more than a few simple<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>words.</p>

    <!-- Name, location, type -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>A month after the initial inspection, the heat still wasn’t working in Román’s apartment, according to Health Department documents. On that date, the department hit PMI and Hi View&#8217;s owner — McKeesport Urban Holdings 2 LLC, which PNC bought in 2018 — with a $2,500 penalty, and a threat of $250 more per day if the heat wasn&#8217;t<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>restored.</p>


    <!-- Name, location, type -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>(On April 16, the department<a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1w-XTJdWpCH0y9XeD3y_HGcT5cTCN7sx_/view?usp=sharing"> filed a judgment</a> in Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas, indicating that the $2,500 penalty had neither been appealed nor paid, and suggesting that the heat had eventually been<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>restored.)</p>

Because Kelvyn often crawls and touches everything, the leaks compelled Román to “be cleaning like crazy,” she<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>said.</p>

    <!-- Name, location, type -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>Before the sun came up, someone fired a bullet into Román’s apartment, blowing holes in her sliding glass door, the curtain and the<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>ceiling.</p>


    <!-- Name, location, type -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>She called the police, named a suspect and got a protection from abuse order. The suspect was criminally charged but promptly posted bond, and Román knew that a PFA wouldn’t shield her, or her sons, from any repeat<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>attempt.</p>


    <!-- Name, location, type -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>She alerted Hi View’s management to the incident and asked for a transfer to another apartment — one hidden from the street from which the bullet was<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>fired.</p>


    <!-- Name, location, type -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>“We can’t sleep since then,” Román said in late May. At that point, she’d been granted no transfer, and there had been no repair to the bullet-pierced glass, let alone the ceiling or<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>curtain.</p>

    <!-- Name, location, type -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>Eleven weeks after a bullet crashed through her sliding glass door, Hi View management finally gave Román the key to a different apartment. She, her kids and a friend went to check it<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>out.</p>


    <!-- Name, location, type -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>The sliding glass door looked out on a small lawn, perfect for Daisy, and a patch of woods. Román noted that there was no street from which anyone could shoot at her. But then she started looking<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>around.</p>

      <p>She discovered water damage to the cabinets, hidden under a loose sheet of linoleum. Face plates on the baseboard heaters that were not secured, and fell off with just a touch, potentially exposing the heating element to Kelvyn’s fingers and toes. A dead bug behind the stove. A live bug crawling around the<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>bathtub.</p>

    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>Cockroaches could exacerbate Kelvyn’s asthma, she fretted. She tried to balance that against the insecurity she felt in her original apartment. What was she going to<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>do?</p>


    <!-- Name, location, type -->

    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>Román accepted the key to the new apartment. Hi View management had assured that it had been fumigated, and that the maintenance crew had fixed the<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>cabinets.</p>


    <!-- Name, location, type -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>The face plates on the baseboard heaters, though, were not repaired. She said she was told that would have to wait until the landlord and manager “fix the whole place, they don’t know<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>when.”</p>


    <!-- Name, location, type -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>After getting the key late on a Wednesday afternoon, she and Jerremy started to move their possessions from their old apartment, across the courtyard, down some stairs and into the new unit. She couldn’t leave Kelvyn alone, though, so it was slow<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>going.</p>

      <p>She said management told her she had to have everything out of her old apartment by Friday. “But how can you only give me two days?” she said, as Kelvyn played in a pile of cushions on the floor. “It’s hard when you have that little<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>kid.”</p>

    <!-- Story text -->

    <!-- Name, location, type -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>As Kelvyn ripped pages from a coloring book on a Saturday morning, his mother sat at the table in the dining room of their new apartment, weeping from the strain of the prior two<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>days.</p>


    <!-- Name, location, type -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>Thursday’s rains had slowed their move. On Friday, she’d criss-crossed the complex some 20 times, she said, with shopping bags full of belongings in each hand, and sometimes with Kelvyn on her back. Most of the time, she had only Jerremy to<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>help.</p>


    <!-- Name, location, type -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>“Sometimes I hurt myself, cut myself,” said Jerremy. “But I kept on moving all her<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>stuff.”</p>


    <!-- Name, location, type -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>Román had asked Hi View’s manager for one more day to finish the move but had been<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>denied.</p>


    <!-- Name, location, type -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>At 4:05 p.m., the manager called and said she’d have to turn in the key by 4:30 p.m., or the company would charge her more than<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>$1,000.</p>


    <!-- Name, location, type -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>That started a frantic effort to empty the old apartment. Román, Jerremy and a few friends threw things out of the windows. In the rush, they broke Román’s bed frame, which they then<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>abandoned.</p>

    <!-- Name, location, type -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>After that, Román stopped moving and wept, she recounted on Saturday. It wasn’t only that she’d failed to move some of Jerremy’s belongings after he had worked with her through two tough days. She also felt humiliated. She wondered whether management had watched, through security cameras, as she’d traversed the courtyard time after time, often with Kelvyn on her<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>back.</p>


    <!-- Name, location, type -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>Jerremy was philosophical.</p>


    <!-- Name, location, type -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>“We didn’t have a lot of time, with [management] bothering us and saying stuff, and then the workers came early to change the locks,” he said. “But at the end of the day, it’s just stuff we can get<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>back.”</p>

    <!-- Name, location, type -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>Román walked across Hi View’s parking lot with paperwork in her hand from the Allegheny County Housing Authority. The papers said she was eligible for a Section 8 voucher — a rent subsidy that would allow her to shop around for affordable housing outside of Hi View. But the papers were dated June 22 and gave her a deadline of July 2. They had been addressed to her old apartment and reached her six days too<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>late.</p>


    <!-- Name, location, type -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>Returning to her new apartment, Román was met by a smiling Kelvyn, but she could not mirror his mood. She said she had asked to retrieve Jerremy’s dresser from her old apartment, but hadn’t been able to. She believed their remaining belongings had been tossed into the<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>trash.</p>


    <!-- Name, location, type -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>Jerremy said he wasn’t too worried about his stuff, though he’d lost some shoes, his middle school diploma and his work permit. He and his mother were working on replacing the<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>EpiPens.</p>


    <!-- Name, location, type -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>Román had that on her mental to-do list. She also wondered if she could line up a translator, call the housing authority and get an extension on the deadline for the Section 8 paperwork. The problems with the landlord, she said, were “too<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>much.”</p>


    <!-- Name, location, type -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
