      <p>The evicted tenant didn’t know where her three-person family would stay the night, how she’d move her belongings and pets, or even whether the dozen chicks huddled in a plastic tub would survive the chilly drizzle. She knew, though, that she wasn’t<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>alone.</p>

    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>It was the day before Thanksgiving and two constables were inside of her former apartment on Wilkinsburg’s South Avenue. She had one car and needed to transport her fiance, the fiance’s teen son, their stuff, multiple dogs, cats, rabbits and parakeets — plus 30 chickens, including the<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>hatchlings.</p>


    <!-- Name, location, type -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>“It’s a shitty time for a hatch,” grumbled the tenant, as she looked down at the chicks. “I hope they don’t &#8230;<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>die.”</p>

The anti-capitalist UNDM wants to thwart evictions, mostly in Pittsburgh’s eastern suburbs.

      <p>UNDM is not, however, a relief organization. Their aim is a world “in which tenants have the ability to say what they want and have it done because their enemies — the landlords, the city, the government — fear them,” said Andre Silverman, a UNDM member, in a later interview. The group is training for “eviction defense” actions that, members say, may include physical prevention of tenant<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>ejections.</p>

    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>UNDM is perhaps the most ideologically strident of several tenants’ rights organizations that have either sprung to life, or become more active, in the year since the pandemic upended the rental housing market. Taking different approaches to tenant organizing are the <a href="https://www.publicsource.org/mass-ejection-impending-evictions-in-allegheny-county-drive-a-scramble-for-changes-and-dollars/">Pittsburgh Union of Regional Renters</a> [PURR] and the Landlord Watchlist<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>Project.</p>

      <p>Asked about tenant activism, Craig Kostelac, who runs North Huntingdon-based Crown Real Estate &amp; Management Systems Inc. and the Landlord Service Bureau, blamed “unprecedented times, financially” and unclear <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/more/pdf/CDC-Eviction-Moratorium-01292021.pdf">pandemic-driven eviction rules</a> for “creating angry tenants and angry<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>landlords.“</p>


    <!-- Name, location, type -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>“It’s not time for finger-pointing,” he said, adding that clarified eviction rules and more effective rent relief would be solutions “not based on politics, but based on what people truly<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>need.”</p>

    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>Since the 1970s, tenant activism has ebbed and flowed in the Pittsburgh area. Pandemic-driven desperation, plus demographic change, could make 2021 a pivotal year for the<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>movement.</p>

      <p>Long said the “unauthorized people” were visiting relatives, that she was not the violent one during a “domestic thing” that occurred, and that she sacrificed her security deposit to address a broken window and other damage.

      <p>Launched in December, the project got 69 responses by mid-February. Tenants alleged each of the above scenarios except threats of harm, led by eviction threats (43%), fees and penalties (38%) and utility cuts or lockouts<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>(31%).</p>

    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>Talk of canceling rent is naive and potentially damaging, according to Kostelac, whose Landlord Service Bureau caters to owners of small numbers of rental properties. “Where’s the fairness?” he asked. Canceling or freezing rent couldn’t work without canceling or freezing things landlords must pay — mortgages, insurance, taxes, utilities and maintenance, he<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>said.</p>

    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>Saying that landlords can just eat those costs is “class warfare,” he said. “Class warfare isn’t healthy for this<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>country.”</p>

    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>A few landlords have sided, in limited ways, with tenant activists. In July, two large, regional landlords — ACTION-Housing and Brandywine Agency — joined advocates including PURR in signing a letter to two Allegheny County judges, urging a full stop to<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>evictions.</p>

      <p>“Everyone deserves a home and the right to advocate for their family’s needs,” Brandywine President John Katz wrote to PublicSource in an email response to questions. “Organizing is how people build power, and I will always support<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>that.”</p>

    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>Kyle Webster, nonprofit ACTION-Housing’s general counsel, said he’d “like to think that we are allies” with PURR, but they don’t always agree. “A very good example of that was last year, when there were a lot of calls by them and others around them to enact a rent freeze,” he said. A freeze, he said, would undercut the financial sustainability of rental<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>properties.</p>

      <p>“I think stuff like [freezing rent] is a bit idealistic,” he said, “but I think that we do need idealistic organizations out there advocating [to lawmakers] in order to get what is actually needed to be approved and<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>passed.”</p>

    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>UNDM doesn’t hide its ideology. Its <a href="http://www.undm.org/2020/12/05/december-day-of-action-preparing-for-january-1st/">chapters</a> in Los Angeles; Austin, Texas; Charlotte, N.C.; San Marcos, Texas; and Pittsburgh recently <a href="http://www.undm.org/2021/01/18/undm-honors-engels-commits-to-fight-in-the-housing-struggle/">celebrated the work of Friedrich Engels</a>, co-author with Karl Marx of <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Friedrich-Engels">The Communist Manifesto</a>. Silverman talks about how “a class is bound together by being exploited or by<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>exploiting.”</p>


    <!-- Name, location, type -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>Usually, though, they tend to emphasize a more tangible mantra: Stop<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>evictions.</p>


    <!-- Name, location, type -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>UNDM member Alex Baker said the group is organizing anti-eviction squads, each made up of trained volunteers with “specifically delineated roles,” like mobilizing the neighbors, making speeches, leading chants, watching out for the police and, where necessary, disrupting the effort to eject the tenant. She said the aim isn&#8217;t “to call up people to just stand outside and say, like, ‘This is bad.’ We want to actually physically prevent<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>it.”</p>

      <p>One target has been CP Development, Wilkinsburg’s largest landlord, and the one that ousted the chicken hobbyist on South Avenue. Last year, UNDM <a href="https://www.publicsource.org/tenants-call-for-rent-strike-against-wilkinsburgs-biggest-landlord-and-fear-retaliation/">called for a rent strike</a> against CP, protested outside of its offices and alleged that the borough was siding with the<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>landlord.</p>


    <!-- Name, location, type -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>In December, a CP employee told police that around 10 protesters, some carrying signs, banged on his windows and door, refused to leave and then took his “no trespassing” sign. A UNDM member was charged with misdemeanor stalking, theft and trespassing. There has, as yet, been no preliminary hearing in the<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>matter.</p>


    <!-- Name, location, type -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>CP’s owners declined to comment on UNDM but issued a statement noting that they are “a family-owned business” that has invested in abandoned and foreclosed properties. “We take care of all of our tenants and believe that the tenant/landlord relationship should be collaborative,” according to the<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>statement.</p>

    <!-- Bug -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>Back on South Avenue, UNDM members did not appear to hinder the constables. Instead, they helped the tenant to carry her belongings out to the damp<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>courtyard.</p>


    <!-- Name, location, type -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>The eviction complaint against the tenant alleged that she violated the lease by subletting, having pets and smoking. The tenant, though, said she had been unemployed since March, and fell behind on rent despite paying some of her unemployment compensation to<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>CP.</p>


    <!-- Name, location, type -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>The tenant said she asked CP to let her stay until Dec. 5 when another landlord was willing to take in her family, but CP was “absolutely not<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>budging.”</p>


    <!-- Name, location, type -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>Baker later claimed that UNDM delayed the family’s ejection, giving them time to prepare and find alternative shelter. She added that the group raised more than $1,000 to help with the family’s relocation to a “little<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>farmhouse.”</p>


    <!-- Name, location, type -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>UNDM hasn’t yet mustered the 25-person fighting force they’d ideally like to have to thwart evictions. “We are weak and the enemy is strong, but there is a long-term trajectory,” said Silverman. “Laws of history show that we are going to be strong, and the enemy is going to be weak. &#8230; So puniness for us is not the problem because we won&#8217;t be puny<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>forever.”</p>
