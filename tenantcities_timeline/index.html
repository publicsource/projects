                            <p>The Allegheny County Health Department received a report of "bathroom ceiling collapsed from upstairs leak," plus leaks in the kitchen and around the base of the toilet and a "mice infestation." The department noted elsewhere that the household included two children under the age of six.</p>

                            <h3 class="timeline-title">First inspection</h3>
                            <p>An inspector reported that the heat was inoperable, and the tenant was using a gas stove to provide heat. Ceiling panels were missing, and there were holes in the wall. The kitchen faucet ran continually, and the cabinet was rotting. The shared laundry room and shared stairways were littered with trash, and an area of shared hallway that had been the scene of a sewer backup had not been disinfected.</p>

                            <h3 class="timeline-title">First violations</h3>
                            <p>The department issued a Notice of Violation based on the inspection two days earlier, demanding that the lack of heat be addressed within six days and the other violations within five weeks.</p>

                            <h3 class="timeline-title">Escrow option</h3>
                            <p>The department also authorized the tenant to pay rent into an escrow account rather than paying the landlord.</p>

                            <h3 class="timeline-title">Tenant unavailable</h3>
                            <p>After the tenant was not home at the time of a scheduled inspection, the inspector tried, but failed, to reach the tenant to schedule another inspection.</p>

                            <p>An inspector found that the heating system was still inoperable, and the tenant was continuing to heat the apartment using the stove. Also unaddressed: the rotting cabinet, holes in the wall and ceiling, and the sewage backup contamination that had not been disinfected. The inspector left a voice mail for property manager Preservation Management Inc. [PMI] but was unable to issue a penalty warning letter because of an information technology problem.</p>

                            <p>The department issued a letter warning that, if the violations were not abated within six days, the landlord would face a civil penalty of $2,500, plus $250 per day that the violations continued. (There is no record that any penalty was actually assessed.)</p>

                            <p>An inspector found that several violations — inoperable heat (except for a space heater), rot below the kitchen sink, failure to disinfect — still had not been addressed.</p>
