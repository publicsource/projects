      <p>Collette Sheridan ran her fingers along the stone countertop, collecting a small heap of red particles in her palm. The skin from her wrist to her elbow was pinkish and splotchy — a condition, she said, that began with the dust that plagues the<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>property.</p>

    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>She and her husband, Richard, sunk their savings into transforming their 10-acre lot into lodging for tourists and workers entering the town of Pinjarra, where Pittsburgh metal maker Alcoa has operated its largest Australian refinery since<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>1972.</p>

      <p>Since 2003, the Sheridans and their three children have battled a cocktail of symptoms: frequent nosebleeds, headaches, breathing difficulties and hair loss. They suspected the Alcoa refinery that looms behind their live-in business may be the cause of their problems, and in 2013, they began to investigate. Lab testing showed dioxins in their blood, they said, and recent urine and hair samples revealed a slew of toxic heavy<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>metals.</p>

      <p>When their chalets began collecting dust, they assumed it came from the 150-foot mounds of bauxite residue next door. The company said there’s no<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>proof.</p>


    <!-- Byline -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>An email from an Alcoa lawyer identified the company’s residue “fingerprints” — which include  the radioactive elements thorium and uranium. The Sheridans sent dust from their chalets to the lab and found high levels of both. Testing at the nearby elementary school and homes as far as 12 miles away also returned the company’s signature, raising questions about the extent to which Alcoa’s waste has encroached on surrounding<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>communities.</p>


    <!-- Byline -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>Six years on, the Sheridans’ chalets have never hosted a sunseeker or a mineworker. The couple is convinced the liability is too great and the dusty rooms too<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>inhospitable.</p>

      <p>Alcoa has mined and refined bauxite in Western Australia since 1963.

      <p>Public health complaints surrounding Alcoa’s Kwinana and Wagerup refineries led to lawsuits, settlements and home buyouts. In Pinjarra, locals describe the physical and mental toll of the dust that blankets the<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>town.</p>

    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>“The last three years is the worst I’ve seen it in a long time,” said one former contractor, Clint Smith, who worked in dust suppression for Alcoa until last April. “They’re environmental<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>vandals.”</p>

    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>Like U.S. Steel is to Pittsburghers, Alcoa is familiar to the people of Pinjarra — a town of around 5,000. Grievances over red dust and concerns about deforestation are common. So are pickup trucks with workers in fluorescent jumpsuits, destined for Alcoa’s mines or the refinery up the road. Streets are named after the company and its operations. Swim teams, racetracks and galleries accept Alcoa<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>sponsorship.</p>

      <p>While locals are quick to point to the jobs the company has employed for generations, they are also steadfast that Alcoa’s legacy — mountains of red sludge totaling nearly 100 billion gallons — will remain far longer than the Americans<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>do.</p>

    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>Those vast piles, which have grown longer and taller each year since Alcoa arrived in the ‘60s, have come under increased scrutiny.

      <p>Janine Quicke was one of the company’s first female refinery workers when she started at Wagerup in 1994. She said she worked hard to prove her value — that is, until a series of progressive health issues, starting in 1999, forced her to leave the job six years<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>later.</p>

    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>Quicke was working on the top of the mills when she saw a plume of smoke waft over her. The smell hit her immediately, but she was back on the ground before the symptoms set in: headaches, nausea, dizziness, rapid heart<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>rate.</p>

      <p>Others tried to claim redress through the courts. Nearly 250 plaintiffs — workers and residents — filed a total of five civil claims in Allegheny County court, aided by Brockovich, in 2009.

      <p>Back at Wagerup, the Pittsburgh company had attempted to address the outcry by establishing a buffer zone through the middle of Yarloop and buying out the homes that fell within it. This, according to some locals, only added to the strife, as neighbors on opposite sides of the dividing line disputed the extent of the<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>impact.</p>

    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>The area was cleared in the early 2000s under a state-led initiative to promote an industrial corridor with a protective buffer zone. But planning setbacks and court rulings upended the<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>vision.</p>

      <p>Twenty years on, a patchwork of empty brownfields occupy a prime slice of suburban Perth, which the government said should be left uninhabited. A planned housing development was blocked by the courts in 2016 on the basis of public health risks. Last year, Alcoa shuttered its refinery, contributing a hulk of aging machinery and vast piles of residue to the area’s uncertain<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>future.</p>

      <p>Kane, now 31, was being treated for leukemia right as public health concerns peaked around the Alcoa refinery, joining a number of former residents who say the refinery caused long-term health problems.

      <p>PublicSource journalists spoke with 19 current and former Alcoa employees and contractors in March. Many described a work environment that was physically dangerous and environmentally irresponsible. Older workers pointed to a shift in workplace culture around the mid-1990s, when they say Pittsburgh began exerting more control from afar, imposing a numbers-first approach on a workforce formed by rural community values. Some added that the company paid well, affording lifestyles that would have been otherwise unattainable for blue-collar workers in small-town<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>Australia.</p>

      <p>Just outside the buffer zone, beyond the line of trees that surrounds Alcoa’s Pinjarra mud lakes and across from Alcoa Road, a small community called Carcoola is the closest to the refinery. Originally built by the company to house employees, it is now a working-class neighborhood, complete with its own school and scores of cul-de-sacs. There, residents say the roofs are layered in red dust, rendering rain collectors unusable. The caustic, chemical odor creeps through windows, and the refinery alarm is heard from the back<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>stoop.</p>

    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>“There’s a lot of people that have problems in Carcoola,” said Kathy O’Connor, who lived there with her two adopted children until last<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>year.</p>

      <p>“I&#8217;m all for making a living and having someone here in our community that supplies so many jobs,” McKinnon said. “But they need to be held accountable for the toxins and the toxic dust and stuff like that that they&#8217;re allowing to just fly<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>around.</p>

      <p>Local governments are concerned that their communities will be permanently marred by<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>Alcoa.</p>

    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>Mining, said Mike Walmsley, president of the Waroona shire, has overtaken a once-thriving farming economy and threatens a precious natural inheritance. “We’ve got to protect what we have<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>left.”</p>


    <!-- Byline -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>Locally, it’s not a fringe perspective. An alliance of five municipalities at the heart of Alcoa’s operations released a position statement seeking to limit mining and its impact in their<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>communities.</p>

      <p>The fate of the company’s mountains of red waste is a looming<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>anxiety.</p>


    <!-- Byline -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>“The residue is Alcoa’s legacy,” said Walmsley, who chairs the local alliance of governments. “We will be custodians of that legacy if and when they<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>leave.”</p>

    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>If the retaining walls broke, as happened at mines in Hungary in 2010 and Brazil in 2019, Walmsley said it could cause “a catastrophic environmental<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>disaster.”</p>
