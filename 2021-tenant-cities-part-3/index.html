    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>On this sunny March morning, there’s a cloud on her financial horizon — one she shares with scores of tenants in The Alden South Hills apartment complex, which sprawls below the<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>library.</p>


    <!-- Name, location, type -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>A winter of car trouble and COVID-19 put her behind on rent. Despite <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-eviction-declaration.html" target="_blank">federal</a> and <a href="https://www.alleghenycourts.us/downloads/administration/LT_Order_February_24_2021.pdf" target="_blank">local</a> curbs on evictions, the complex’s owner filed a Landlord and Tenant Complaint against her — an eviction case. On March 15, she’s due before District Judge Ralph Kaiser for a Recovery of Real Property Hearing. That’s legalese for: The landlord wants you<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>out.</p>


    <!-- Name, location, type -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>Truth be told, she’d like to move. Her one-bedroom apartment is always hot – “super uncomfortable,” she says – and the $644 in rent, not including utilities and various fees, seems high. But finding a new place might be<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>tough.</p>


    <!-- Name, location, type -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>“So what I’m worried about most now is that my name has an eviction record, and I’m trying to get out of here,&quot; Nyirenda says. Other landlords may turn her<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>down.</p>

      <p>The Alden, run by Philadelphia-based <a href="https://aionmanagement.com/" target="_blank">multi-state landlord Aion Management</a>, is Allegheny County&#8217;s eviction hotspot. This diverse suburban complex of 1,050 apartments, within <a href="https://censusreporter.org/profiles/06000US4200303928-baldwin-borough-allegheny-county-pa/" target="_blank">otherwise homeowner-dominated Baldwin Borough</a>, has seen 111 eviction cases since COVID arrived, according to data assembled by Anne Wright, chief technology officer of <a href="https://renthelppgh.org/" target="_blank">RentHelpPGH</a> and a <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/news/stories/archives/2020/november/earthtime-evictions.html" target="_blank">project scientist</a> at Carnegie Mellon University&#8217;s CREATE<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>Lab.</p>

    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>While it makes up 0.5% of the county’s rental units, The Alden accounts for nearly 4% of the pandemic-era eviction cases in Allegheny<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>County.</p>

      <p>The eviction filings reflect “residents who have ignored our inquiries, have ignored our phone calls, have ignored our emails, and we&#8217;re trying to get them on track,&quot; says Robin Flagler, president of Aion, in a Monday interview. &quot;We have over $500,000 of outstanding rents at The Alden.

      <p>Late last year, car trouble compelled her to stop moonlighting for Lyft, and she fell behind on rent. The landlord added $265 in “attorney fees” to her bill, so she borrowed from a friend to pay $785 on Christmas Day. On New Year’s Day, she was diagnosed with COVID-19, and during a month of illness, she lost pay and burned all of her time off. She paid $500 toward her rent debt on Jan. 15. The landlord filed to evict two weeks later, saying she still owed $785. She took unpaid time off for a Feb. 11 hearing – only to find that it was<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>postponed.</p>

      <p>The eviction complaint that could lead to the family’s ejection says they fell behind by $678.60.

      <p>The CDC’s order generally bars ejection of tenants if they say their ability to pay rent has been compromised by the pandemic. A <a href="https://www.alleghenycourts.us/downloads/administration/LT_Order_February_24_2021.pdf" target="_blank">Feb. 24 order</a> by Allegheny County President Judge Kim Berkeley Clark says that if the CDC order applies to a case, it is to be put on hold until the CDC order expires – <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s0129-extending-eviction-moratorium.html" target="_blank">currently March 31</a>. If the CDC order doesn’t apply, cases can still be postponed, for three to five weeks, if the tenant is applying for rent relief or if the eviction is due to the expiration of a lease. Other cases can<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>proceed.</p>

    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>Before the pandemic, the owners of The Alden were already among the county’s top filers of eviction cases. They filed 266 cases in 2019, according to <a href="https://www.alleghenycountyanalytics.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/20-ACDHS-19-Eviction_v5.pdf" target="_blank">a report</a> by the Allegheny County Department of Human Services and The Pittsburgh Foundation. That placed them fifth among landlords, behind three public housing authorities and the Brandywine Agency, which manages 3,500 rental units throughout the<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>county.</p>

      <p>Overall, 2020 eviction filings in Allegheny County were down 60% from the prior year. The housing authorities have reduced (but not eliminated) evictions. Brandywine edges out The Alden&#8217;s ownership in terms of total eviction<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>cases.</p>

      <p>But The Alden&#8217;s filings make suburban ZIP Code 15236 the top in Allegheny County for eviction cases. Kaiser&#8217;s court, where all of The Alden’s evictions are heard, is ground zero for<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>hearings.</p>


    <!-- Name, location, type -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>Kaiser says he’s postponing most of the landlord-tenant cases, due to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/more/pdf/CDC-Eviction-Moratorium-01292021.pdf" target="_blank">Centers for Disease Control&#8217;s order</a> barring evictions under certain circumstances.

      <p>The City of Pittsburgh has seen <a href="https://www.publicsource.org/developpghbulletins-pittsburgh-allegheny-county/#evictionvote" target="_blank">activism and city council legislation</a> to further restrict landlords. Mayor Bill Peduto signed a virtual eviction ban last week, but the Landlord Service Bureau has sued the city, asking the county court to declare it unconstitutional. By contrast, Baldwin Borough officials didn’t know, until a PublicSource reporter told them, that their municipality of 19,752 residents was an eviction<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>epicenter.</p>

      <p>Borough Manager Robert Firek and Community Compliance Officer Todd Tulowitzki say they have heard no discussion of the evictions within the borough&#8217;s government.

    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>The first $110 pays Aion’s attorneys, Bootay Bevington &amp; Nichols, and covers all of their work on an eviction unless it is appealed to Common Pleas Court. The rest covers a court fee that depends on the number of tenants involved in the<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>eviction.</p>

      <p>“We in many cases will waive [the attorney fee] if the resident&#8217;s willing to to get current or get on a payment program,&quot; Flagler<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>says.</p>

    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>When landlords file claims against tenants, they list the overdue rent, any additional rent that will be due by the time of the hearing, any damage costs they blame on the tenant, and attorney fees, generating a total claim amount. RentHelpPGH’s database of 3,499 pandemic-era eviction cases in Allegheny County shows an average total claim of<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>$2,856.</p>


    <!-- Name, location, type -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>The total claims against The Alden’s tenants average $2,090, suggesting the landlord is comparatively quick to<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>evict.</p>


    <!-- Name, location, type -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>The total claim against Moran is $1,350 – $384 in overdue rent, $856 in anticipated future rent and a $110 attorney<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>charge.</p>


    <!-- Name, location, type -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>She admits that Christmas, two December birthdays and a shift in her pay schedule “put us behind.” But she believes that other landlords provide more leeway. “We weren’t even a full month behind before we were being, you know, taken to<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>court.”</p>


    <!-- Name, location, type -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>The fees make it worse, and the timing rankles. “I mean, I understand that from a business standpoint, that you have to do what you have to do, but we’re also in the middle of a pandemic,” Moran<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>says.</p>


    <!-- Name, location, type -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>Still, her approach has been to “buckle down and pay it” rather than fight. “I don’t want to be put in a position where we have to go to court and we owe,” she says, “and then we are facing actual eviction, because with three kids and a work-from-home job, without an address, you know, that just isn’t going to<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>fly.”</p>

      <p>The landlord’s claim against her totals $1,640. She says her troubles started in November, when she quit a job as a dog groomer. “I probably put in at least 60 applications” for employment, even applying to work for Aion, she says. But the job market proved<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>tough.</p>
