      <p>It took four Noongar men to hoist the warm, lifeless kangaroo onto the hooked limb from which they skinned and gutted their kill. Working the carcass with an agile knife, 28-year-old Christopher Nannup carved lean chunks from the tangle of fur and sinew. Ribs, thighs, torso and tail were loaded onto the truck to be shared among family and<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>friends.</p>

      <p>Christopher and his nephews represent the next generation of the Noongar, who have inhabited Australia’s southwestern tip for 50,000 years. Their local corporation recently acquired rights to occupy and manage the land on which they shot three kangaroos and netted 20-something mullet fish during an afternoon in late March. But this amounts to a small gain in a story of colonization, dislocation and recurring threats to the land now fronted by a Pittsburgh corporation mining the Northern Jarrah Forest, named for a distinctive slow-growing gum<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>tree.</p>

      <p>Since 1963, Alcoa has mined bauxite from the foothills of Australia’s Darling Range under a special political agreement that skirts regulation, guarantees access to scarce water and assures low royalty<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>rates.</p>


    <!-- Byline -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>What was once a modest mining operation has become one of the global industry’s leading operations. Australian ore now generates about three-quarters of Alcoa’s total production of alumina — an oxide refined from bauxite and smelted into aluminum to make smartphones, computers, skyscrapers, electric vehicles, solar panels and wind turbines. And as global climate goals stress building more to emit less, the North Shore-headquartered metal maker seeks more to keep up with <a href="https://rmi.org/our-work/climate-intelligence/horizon-zero/aluminum-sector/#:~:text=The%20aluminum%20sector%20is%20currently,to%2080%20percent%20by%202050.">surging</a> demand — to build, <a href="https://www.alcoa.com/global/en/stories/releases?id=2021/10/advancing-sustainably-alcoas-2050-net-zero-ambition">Alcoa says</a>, the green energy<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>future.</p>

      <p>Alcoa’s Australian lease, spanning nearly 5,000 square miles, cuts across much of the remaining Northern Jarrah Forest, with over 8,000 unique plant and animal species. The company’s mining footprint has grown in recent years, and it’s seeking approval for its biggest expansion to<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>date.</p>


    <!-- Byline -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>In 2023, when a former Alcoa boss told Wall Street analysts the company had “no fixed timetable” for securing new mining approvals in the jarrah forest, corporate stock dropped more than 7%, or $650<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>million.</p>


    <!-- Byline -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>From Alcoa headquarters overlooking the Allegheny River in January, Alcoa CEO William Oplinger told investors clinching the expansion approval is of “paramount<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>importance.”</p>


    <!-- Byline -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>Alcoa’s proposal to mine three vast new jarrah tracts — totaling the approximate square mileage of Pittsburgh — is under review by the state government. The company’s many prior expansions have never undergone this<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>process.</p>


    <!-- Byline -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>Alcoa has, in recent years, sought more and higher quality bauxite. To find it, the company has mined closer to rural communities and within protected drinking water<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>reservoirs.</p>


    <!-- Byline -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>Western Australian authorities have <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/interactive/hub/media/tearout-excerpt/30655/FOI-869---Document-8---Catchment-Risk-Assessment-Framework---Alcoa-2023---2027-MMP.pdf">warned</a> that if Alcoa is allowed to expand, contamination of drinking water for the city of Perth, and its population of 2.3 million, is “considered certain,” and could endanger water quality in “most, if not all,” of Perth’s drinking water dams. They cautioned that long-term development of the region could be stunted by resulting costs and water<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>shortages.</p>


    <!-- Byline -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>“The relationship between Alcoa and the Western Australian community is in a period of change,” said Travis Robinson, a former chief of staff to the state environmental minister who now runs a private equity firm in Perth with mining interests among its<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>portfolio.</p>


    <!-- Byline -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>Alcoa did not respond to repeated requests for interviews or comment for this<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>story.</p>

      <p class="pullquote">“Two things want bauxite: The Aluminum Company of America and the jarrah forest. They both have an utter, total dependence on it. Who wins?”</p>

    <!-- Asterisk divider -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>The company has long said it effectively rehabilitates the forest that it clears, producing <a href="https://www.alcoa.com/australia/en/pdf/WA-Environmental-Research.pdf">company-sponsored research</a> to back its claims. In its most recent sustainability <a href="https://www.alcoa.com/sustainability/pdf/2023-Sustainability-Report.pdf">report</a>, Alcoa acknowledged increased scrutiny of its forest rehabilitation practices and the company’s “potential impact on Perth’s drinking water<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>supply.”</p>


    <!-- Byline -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>Alcoa said it is “committed to enhance the way it operates in order to comply with stricter environmental requirements, including enhanced protection for drinking water and biodiversity, reduced forest clearing and accelerated forest<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>rehabilitation.”</p>

      <p>“There&#8217;s only been Europeans in this country for 200 years, and the impact that we&#8217;ve had on the natural environment is just extraordinary,” said Jess Beckerling, an incoming state legislator who petitioned for the review of Alcoa’s expansion. “And even though we&#8217;re not the traditional or the rightful custodians of this country, we have a custodianship<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>responsibility.”</p>

      <p>In 2022, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the United Nations’ chief climate body, <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-11/">declared</a> the Northern Jarrah Forest critically endangered by a warming world. Hotter, dryer seasons and bushfires plague the<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>forest.</p>


    <!-- Byline -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>Mining, scientists say, threatens to push the forest over the edge. If more is lost, the entire ecosystem could collapse, and with it hundreds of unique species endemic to the Darling Range, including black cockatoos, numbats, quokkas and<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>bandicoots.</p>

      <p>“The forest has been taken to its knees,” said <a href="https://staffportal.curtin.edu.au/staff/profile/view/kingsley-dixon-9fb980a0/">Kingsley Dixon</a>, an Australian botanist, and director of the ARC Centre for Mine Site Restoration, who worked with Alcoa for decades to rehabilitate forest<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>ecosystems.</p>

      <p>The leafy canopy stood 100 feet above Dixon as he inspected the charred, bristly trunk of a kingia australis. Its sharp, grasslike leaves fell like narrow daggers, and the scientist held a seed pod the size of an apple to the afternoon<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>sunlight.</p>


    <!-- Byline -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>“This is an immortal plant,” Dixon, 71, remarked. The species evolved nearly 120 million years<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>ago.</p>


    <!-- Byline -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>The trunks were blackened with charcoal and the pods had begun to flower. The kingia australis grows no more than an inch each year, Dixon said, naturally engineered to thrive in the unrelenting climate of the Darling<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>Range.</p>


    <!-- Byline -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>“They’re just extraordinary,” Dixon said, estimating the plants before him to be no less than 500 years old. Grass trees — “some of the oldest flowering plants in terms of their ancestry on earth,” — stood beneath jarrah and marri trees in a cluster nearby. Underfoot, the small leaves of hibbertia poked through the forest<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>floor.</p>

      <p>The jarrah forest’s location on the western coast of Australia, surrounded by ocean and desert, is a natural isolating force that has, over millennia, formed a “totally unique system,” Dixon<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>explained.</p>

      <p>In 1974, Dixon was a 20-year-old summer intern at Alcoa, working to regrow mine sites. &quot;I just thought we could solve the jarrah forest,” he recounted. “That was the vision of the company.” Dixon later founded a research center, discovered that smoke from bushfires could prompt germination, and worked with Alcoa as a contractor from what he called &quot;the leading restoration research group in the world on native<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>ecosystems.&quot;</p>


    <!-- Byline -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>But after the turn of the millennium, mining “was starting to skyrocket,&#8221; he said, touching areas previously thought off-limits. Rehabilitation could not keep up and his center dissociated from<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>Alcoa.</p>

    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>In 2022, the botanist was one of a team of scientists to <a href="https://www.ser.org/news/625464/Worlds-first-global-standards-for-mine-site-restoration-launched-at-COP15.htm">develop new international standards for mine site restoration</a>, which launched that year in Montreal at the United Nations’ convention on biological diversity. The standards, Dixon explained, are based on a concept of native reference, which marks the forest for how it resembles and functions as its former, native<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>self.</p>

      <p>Dixon’s ramshackle Toyota Hilux bounced along a former hauling road cut through the forest, a few hundred yards past where he had stopped to examine the kingia. Soon, the landscape opened into an Alcoa forest restoration site — a flat plain marked by ruts reaching to the crest of the bare<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>hilltop.</p>


    <!-- Byline -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>A 700-year-old jarrah lay felled and charred in the dirt, positioned by Alcoa as a habitat that might one day support plant and<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>wildlife.</p>


    <!-- Byline -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>This forest, Dixon explained, would never be the same. The rows of scattered seedlings poking through the dirt were “ecologically meaningless,” he said, against a backdrop of unmined forest at the<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>perimeter.</p>

      <p>As a condition of its agreement with the state, Alcoa must rehabilitate the land it mines. In the 1970s, the company developed a mine site restoration program, leading it to be the first mining company recognized by the United Nations Global 500 Roll of Honour for Rehabilitation Excellence in 1990. In 2001, Alcoa <a href="https://www.alcoa.com/australia/en/news/releases?id=2023/11/alcoa-continues-successful-rehabilitation-of-jarrah-forest-ecosystem&amp;year=y2023">said</a> it had achieved 100% plant species<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>return.</p>


    <!-- Byline -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>But the trial, based on Dixon’s research, could not be replicated at scale, he<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>said.</p>


    <!-- Byline -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>Last year, Dixon published <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/rec.14236">new research</a>, which found Alcoa’s rehabilitated mine sites lacked the biodiversity that defines unmined jarrah. Crucial plant species were “effectively absent,” and replanted forest would not sustain key animal species. The reason, the researchers posited, could be the removal of the bauxite on which the ecosystem<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>evolved.</p>

    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>In November, 154 Australian scientists <a href="https://theleeuwingroup.org.au/_data/papers/ALCOA_DESTROYING_OUR_FORESTS.pdf">published a letter</a> that called on the Australian government to “halt the destruction of one of the world’s most important and biodiverse temperate forests — for future generations, for the sake of the planet and to avert an extinction<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>catastrophe.”</p>


    <!-- Byline -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>“We wanted to put on the table, once and for all, a correction of the mythology that they are putting back a jarrah forest,” Dixon said. “First Nations know it. Bushwalkers know it. Local communities know it. … They all know it&#8217;s not coming<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>back.”</p>

      <p>At Alcoa’s southernmost mining outpost, a dump truck the size of a two-story duplex was loaded with 206 tons of bauxite from a dusty pit, destined for “the crusher” — a hulking rock grinder that feeds rubble ore to an 11-mile conveyor belt supplying the refinery around the<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>clock.</p>


    <!-- Byline -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>The company mines about 34 million metric tons annually to generate about 9 million metric tons of<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>alumina.</p>


    <!-- Byline -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>The bauxite is found 10 to 20 feet below ground in a gravelly layer above the bedrock. To get it, Alcoa rips out the trees and bulldozes the topsoil, using explosives to blast through layers of rock. Once the bauxite is extracted, the dirt is returned and the top layers planted with seeds — beginning the process of<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>rehabilitation.</p>


    <!-- Byline -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>Alcoa employs a team of scientists who continue to study and write about its rehabilitation methods. The company <a href="https://www.alcoa.com/sustainability/pdf/2023-Sustainability-Report.pdf#page=81">maintained in 2023</a> that it had rehabilitated 75% of the forest it has mined in Western<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>Australia.</p>


    <!-- Byline -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>A government agency reached a different conclusion. As of 2023, “no areas have been assessed by the state as meeting the completion criteria” for rehabilitation, according to a memo from the Western Australian Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>Attractions.</p>


    <!-- Byline -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>During a public tour of Alcoa’s rehabilitation areas attended by Public Source journalists, Tanya Patterson, a community education officer at Alcoa, said the company continues to hone its methods and has improved upon original guidance set by the state government when their programming<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>began.</p>


    <!-- Byline -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>“We have done our own research and come up with better ways of rehabilitation,” Patterson<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>said.</p>

      <p>Perhaps bauxite mining’s most emblematic victims are the three black cockatoo species native to the Darling<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>Range.</p>

      <p>The converging threats of climate change, suburban expansion and habitat loss from logging and mining have brought the Baudin’s black cockatoo to the brink of extinction. Experts estimate there could be as few as 2,500 mature adults in the<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>wild.</p>

      <p>The center on the outskirts of Perth takes in sick and injured birds and nurses them to health before releasing them into the wild. Most are struck by cars or attacked by ravens, but last year they admitted many birds found weak from<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>starvation.</p>

    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>Cockatoos depend on the nuts of the jarrah and marri trees and nest in the hollows that form within their trunks once they reach about 200 years of growth. But decades of mining and logging have shrunk the once-sprawling forest, and few remaining trees are old and large enough to support nesting<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>sites.</p>

      <p>Alcoa claims it takes measures to avoid harming cockatoos by marking trees they’re known to inhabit to indicate they should not be felled.

      <p>When Martin’s ancestors prayed for rain, tradition maintains, the Woggle slithered inland, drawing water in her wake as she formed the region’s sustaining rivers and tributaries. Humans were then made custodians of the<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>land.</p>

    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>Over tens of thousands of years, the Noongar developed methods to protect and nurture their natural surroundings: controlled burns to prevent larger fires from raging, limits on hunting birds during nesting season, totem assignments marking each individual with an animal they must care for and abstain from<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>eating.</p>

    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>All this amounts to an intricate system of balance, according to Daniel Garlett, an activist and former manager for the South West Aboriginal Land and Sea<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>Council.</p>

    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>“All that’s naturally asked of us, not just First Nations people, is that you take and you give and give and take, living in harmony with Mother Nature,” Garlett said. “You’ve got to love that country like your own<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>mother.”</p>

      <p>Daniel Garlett, a Noongar elder, plays his didgeridoo beside his daughter. Garlett has felt a strong responsibility to the environment since having a vision as a child where, he recalled, &#8220;I fell on my knees and cried for my<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>country.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Alcoa engages Indigenous peoples both through voluntary efforts and in ways required by law. It recently concluded its second “<a href="https://www.alcoa.com/australia/en/pdf/Alcoa-Reconciliation-Action-Plan.pdf">Reconciliation Action Plan</a>” that laid out steps for supporting and consulting with First Nations communities in light of the continent’s “rich<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>diversity.”</p>

      <p>Several Noongar leaders, though, say their relationship with Alcoa has deteriorated in recent years as the pace of deforestation has<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>quickened.</p>


    <!-- Byline -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>Trevor Stack of the Winjan Corporation, a community organization representing Noongar in an area near Pinjarra, said he used to sit at the table with Alcoa when he felt they were operating in good<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>faith.</p>


    <!-- Byline -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>“Over the years we just made a decision that with Winjan — where we’re at and where Alcoa are at, where they come in and they decimate the land, and we as Aboriginal people, we look after the land — we can’t be seen sitting with these guys,” Stack said. “It’s not a good<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>look.”</p>


    <!-- Byline -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>Garlett took a hardline stance against Alcoa when he used to represent Noongar claims under “native title,” a legal principle that gives traditional owners limited rights to weigh in on planned uses of their ancestral<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>land.</p>


    <!-- Byline -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>Garlett felt Alcoa’s offers amounted to “petty things,” like school uniforms, refrigerators and occasional apprenticeships, often accepted out of<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>desperation.</p>


    <!-- Byline -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>“This story is: They preyed on First Nations people’s impoverished lifestyles to do as they please,” Garlett said of the Pittsburgh<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>company.</p>


    <!-- Byline -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>“And I can say that, because I had a firsthand seat at those negotiation tables, that I was disgusted and still am,” he<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>added.</p>

      <p>Alcoa did not respond to Public Source questions about its interactions with Indigenous<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>communities.</p>

    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>The competition around the limited seats at the company table has brought strife among former friends within the Noongar community, according to Mary Walley, whose father Clary is by birth the most senior Noongar in<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>Pinjarra.</p>


    <!-- Byline -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>“That’s why all the families argue now. It’s because of Alcoa,” she<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>said.</p>

    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>The central connection between the Noongar and their country means the fate of the jarrah forest is far more than an aesthetic or lifestyle consideration, said Brad Vitale of the Harvey Aboriginal Corporation, a community organization based 20 miles south of<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>Pinjarra.</p>


    <!-- Byline -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>Vitale believes a lot of the struggles that plague aboriginal communities — such as mental health, self-esteem and unemployment — stem from land destruction and the community’s dislocation from<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>it.</p>
