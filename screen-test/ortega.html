      <p>This year, schools across the state pivoted like never before. They navigated and braved virtual learning, and now, a year later, are left to solve the learning chasms exacerbated by the pandemic – all in the midst of a transition in leadership at the Pennsylvania Department of<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>Education.</p>


    <!-- Subhed -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>Acting Secretary <a href="https://www.education.pa.gov/Pages/Secretary-Biography.aspx" target="_blank">Noe Ortega</a> took the reins of the department in October 2020 as the country was seeing unprecedented levels of COVID cases and the school year was underway. <a href="https://www.media.pa.gov/pages/Education-details.aspx?newsid=910#:~:text=Ortega%20will%20replace%20Pedro%20Rivera,all%20students%2C%E2%80%9D%20said%20Gov." target="_blank">Gov. Tom Wolf appointed Ortega</a> after former secretary Pedro Rivera departed his post to become president of Thaddeus Stevens College of Technology on Oct. 1. Leading up to his appointment, Ortega was the department’s deputy secretary and commissioner for the Office of Postsecondary and Higher<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>Education.</p>


    <!-- Subhed -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>Wolf cited Ortega’s record of focusing on equity and access issues among students and noted that he spearheaded the state’s efforts to diversify its educators. Across Allegheny County’s 43 school districts and 22 charter schools, <a href="https://8rri53pm0cs22jk3vvqna1ub-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/RFA-New-Data-on-Teacher-Diversity-PACER-FINAL.pdf" target="_blank">4.5% of teachers are people of color</a>, despite students of color making up 32% of all<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>students.</p>


    <!-- Subhed -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>With a new presidential administration, a new school year on the horizon and a new leader, the Pennsylvania Department of Education [PDE] is the captain for hundreds of school districts searching for guidance on how to educate in a coronavirus<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>environment.</p>

      <p>PublicSource&#8217;s TyLisa C. Johnson spoke with Ortega in March on topics ranging from the road ahead for Pennsylvania schools and how the department will address learning loss to district funding needs and lessons learned this year to move the department forward in an unpredictable<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>future.</p>


    <!-- Subhed -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>Ortega described how teachers are rethinking their roles, what students have lost without brick-and-mortar buildings, and potential strategies to fix learning loss, including the possibility of summer<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>school.</p>


    <!-- Subhed -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>“It&#8217;s obvious that we&#8217;re going to have to figure out ways to accelerate learning,” Ortega said during the wide-ranging interview. “We&#8217;re going to have to figure out how to do it in nontraditional<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>times.”</p>

          <p><b>QUESTION:</b> You made several points, but the one thread I’d like to follow was when you mentioned how to prepare educators in the classroom. In the past, you've led department efforts to improve diversity in the workforce of state educators. And for context, in Pittsburgh and across Allegheny County, there's a significant lack of teachers of color, especially and in particular Black teachers when compared to student demographics. I'm curious about your thoughts as we get new, preliminary data about student performance in this virtual learning environment. How do the efforts for a more diverse and inclusive teacher workforce and more relevant approaches to teaching fit into this moment now that we're in a pandemic?</p>
          <p><em>Teacher demographics in Allegheny County, while becoming more diverse, <a href="https://www.researchforaction.org/allegheny-county-teachers-of-color/" target="_blank">still don’t match student demographics</a>. Students of color make up <a href="https://www.researchforaction.org/allegheny-county-teachers-of-color/" target="_blank">35% of students enrolled</a> in county public schools, but teachers of color make up only <a href="https://www.researchforaction.org/allegheny-county-teachers-of-color/" target="_blank">4.5% of the workforce</a>. The county in 2019-20 employed a lower percentage of teachers of colors than the state average; more than half of the county’s teachers of color are employed by Pittsburgh Public Schools.</em></p>
