      <p>She roused her husband, Scott, and their 11-year-old daughter, Piper. She stepped out onto the porch and she could smell it: That familiar burnt chemical scent, like a perm solution in the distance, hanging heavy in the<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>air.</p>

      <p>Piper said she could smell it in the living room. Scott, a coal miner and veteran U.S. Marine, said he had a metallic, acid taste in the sides of his<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>mouth.</p>

      <p>The family hurried to their Jeep and left Knob Fork, heading west up Mountaineer Highway. Abby’s head and arms ached. As Scott drove, she<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>journaled.</p>

      <p>As the Tennants crested the hill above their home, they passed EQT’s compressor station, one of four the company operated in West Virginia. There, six 1,775-horsepower engines pressurize the fracked gasses piped from nearby wells, including from the Sizemore Pad, a nine-bore well pad at the bottom of the hollow. Hidden behind a bend, four 50,000-gallon open-top tanks hold the briney, <a href="https://new.nsf.gov/news/recent-research-analyzes-chemical-composition">toxic liquids</a> left over from shale gas<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>extraction.</p>

      <p>Abby wrote that the pain and nausea worsened until they passed the 4-H camp in New Martinsville, more than 20 miles away. From town, Abby called her neighbor Trina Hollabaugh to tell her to leave her house, but she was already at her cabin, miles from home, and she invited the Tennants to join her. They arrived at the cabin at 3:15 a.m. and spent the<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>night.</p>

      <p>When Piper woke up, she was short of breath. Bright red rashes stretched across her chest, stomach, back and arms. Abby had the rashes and trouble breathing, too, she wrote.

      <p>Since Pittsburgh-based EQT expanded its presence in Knob Fork, four neighboring families have abandoned homes. Members report respiratory, cardiovascular and neurological symptoms and have documented their observations in repeated complaints to the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection [WVDEP] and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>[EPA].</p>

      <p>The tiny village&#8217;s travails come as EQT is expanding its presence in the Mountain State, following <a href="https://media.eqt.com/investor-relations/news/news-release-details/2023/EQT-Completes-Acquisition-of-Tug-Hill-and-XcL-Midstream/default.aspx">the August acquisition</a> — for $5.2 billion in cash and stock — of the gas producer Tug Hill, dramatically increasing the company&#8217;s Appalachian footprint. The Tug Hill buy is part of EQT&#8217;s bid to lead, <a href="https://www.eqt.com/responsibility/unleashing-us-lng/">as the company puts it</a>, &quot;the largest green initiative on the<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>planet.&quot;</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, the U.S. EPA is investigating the company’s operations in Knob Fork. A March 2023 EPA inspection found leaks and unexpected hydrocarbon emissions from EQT’s pollution control devices in the<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>hollow.</p>

      <p>EQT declined to make CEO Toby Rice available for an interview and did not respond to 27 questions from PublicSource about its operations in Knob Fork and West<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>Virginia.</p>

    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>According to WVDEP records, EQT’s emissions contain, among other chemicals, <a href="https://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/benzene/basics/facts.asp">benzene</a> and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/toluene/default.html">toluene</a>, <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/TSP/ToxFAQs/ToxFAQsDetails.aspx?faqid=382&amp;toxid=66">ethylbenzene</a>, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/xylene/default.html">xylene</a>, <a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2016-09/documents/hexane.pdf">hexane</a> and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/formaldehyde/default.html#:~:text=Formaldehyde%20(CH%E2%82%82O)%20is%20a%20colorless,antiseptics%2C%20medicines%2C%20and%20cosmetics.">formaldehyde</a> — all classified as volatile organic compounds [VOCs].

      <p>In total, EQT equipment in and around the hollow is permitted annually to release more than 30 tons of VOCs, nearly 34 tons of nitrous oxide and more than 31 tons of carbon monoxide. Prior to September 2023, the permits allowed significantly lower emissions, but WVDEP approved EQT’s requested increases — based on the company’s own sampling data — despite citizen complaints of odors and ailments consistent with VOC<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>exposure.</p>

      <p>West Virginia wasn&#8217;t always the focus of EQT&#8217;s drilling. That is<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>changing.</p>


    <!-- Byline-->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>In September 2023, EQT’s 42-year-old CEO, Toby Rice, stepped up to a small stage at Grandvue Park, 30 miles north of Knob Fork in Moundsville, West<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>Virginia.</p>


    <!-- Byline-->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>“For those of you that don&#8217;t know EQT, we are America&#8217;s largest natural gas producer,” he<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>began.</p>


    <!-- Byline-->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>The town hall presentation was intended for locals — like the Tennants and Kennedys — whose gas rights EQT leased, and followed stops in Pennsylvania’s Washington and Greene counties. The crowd wore a mix of corporate attire, denim and boots. Rice wore a button-down shirt checkered with corporate hues of blue and pink, AllBirds sneakers and an Apple<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>Watch.</p>


    <!-- Byline-->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>The month prior, EQT bought Tug Hill’s regional network of leases, pipelines and compressor stations. With that purchase, Rice said, EQT could extract more than 6.3 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day — the energy equivalent, he posited, of a million barrels of oil. “It&#8217;s pretty amazing to think about that much energy being produced by one company,” he<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>said.</p>


    <!-- Byline-->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>EQT maintains most of its core production in Southwestern Pennsylvania, where it operates 1,625 wells. In West Virginia, the company operates 1,002, but with the Tug Hill acquisition, EQT bought access to more than 2,000 untapped locations in the Mountain State. “We have enough inventory to be able to drill and hold that production flat and produce energy reliably for decades,” Rice<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>said.</p>


    <!-- Byline-->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>The corporation’s campaign to expand natural gas production was spelled out in the town hall’s branding: Unleash LNG. In 2023, the United States became the world’s <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/us-was-top-lng-exporter-2023-hit-record-levels-2024-01-02/">largest exporter of liquefied natural gas</a>, or LNG, spurred by the disruption of European gas supplies after Russia invaded Ukraine. In Moundsville, EQT staffers handed out trucker hats emblazoned with a patch that read “Marcellus Over<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>Moscow.”</p>


    <!-- Byline-->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>Surging gas prices meant EQT leaseholder payments rocketed from $350 million in 2020 to more than $1.8 billion in 2022, Rice said. In 2023, the company reported <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ixviewer/ix.html?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/33213/000003321324000008/eqt-20231231.htm#ie0b378c37216402fa1fab6dafbf447c8_76">profits of more than $1.7<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>billion</a>.</p>


    <!-- Byline-->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>Rice touted EQT’s “electric frac fleets” as a way of reducing the company’s emissions. <a href="https://ir.eqt.com/investor-relations/news/news-release-details/2020/US-Well-Services-Inc-and-EQT-Corporation-Finalize-Long-Term-Electric-Frac-Contract/default.aspx">That method of hydraulic fracturing</a> — the technology employed at the Sizemore pad — uses methane from the well, instead of diesel, to power the equipment on the<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>pad.</p>


    <!-- Byline-->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>With more pipelines to transport EQT’s gas from Appalachia, he said, U.S. LNG could displace coal power in other parts of the world and help to reduce global emissions by substituting a cleaner-burning fossil<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>fuel.</p>

    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p class="pullquote">“Because what we're doing here in Appalachia is a case study for how hydrocarbon production can be done responsibly.”</p>

    <!-- Asterisk divider -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>Opposing this claim are 170 <a href="https://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Scientists-CP2-Letter-Final.pdf">scientists</a> who have pushed for the Biden administration to reject LNG expansion while citing grave climate concerns. In January, the administration announced it would <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/26/biden-delays-cp2-louisiana-lng-export-project">pause approvals</a> for all new LNG export terminals, much <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2024-01-31/eqt-s-rice-on-biden-s-lng-pause-video">to the chagrin</a> of Rice, who called the decision “bad<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>policy.”</p>


    <!-- Byline-->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>Rice’s campaign seeks a fourfold expansion of American liquefied natural gas exports abroad, effectively “adding a Saudi Arabia of energy to the world stage,” Rice said in<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>Moundsville.</p>


    <!-- Byline-->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>If he got his way, 70% of that new domestic drilling would occur in the Appalachian Basin, which extends from New York through much of Pennsylvania into western Ohio and almost all of West<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>Virginia.</p>

      <p>In internal WVDEP emails that day, staff from the agency’s Office of Oil and Gas noted EQT had been fracking the pad for several weeks and was completing an “electric frac.” There were some trucks and a generator on the pad emitting exhaust fumes, the email noted, but otherwise, the agency believed there was “no mechanism to generate the VOCs the anonymous complainant claims.” (On Jan. 25, an internal WVDEP email noted that the at-home air monitors were capable of “providing a baseline that would allow you to tell if VOC concentrations were up or<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>down.”)</p>

      <p>On Feb. 21, EQT agreed to meet with the three families and members of the WVDEP in the Kennedys’ garage.

      <p>During the three-and-a-half-hour meeting, the EQT representatives assured the families that their operations were clean, compliant and safe, according to multiple attendees and a written summary by WVDEP. EQT said they monitored the pad remotely. From operational headquarters in Canonsburg, the company said it could view the temperatures, pressure and water levels, and had an automated gas detection system, Abby recorded in her notes. They looked for leaks using optical gas imaging cameras quarterly and made any necessary repairs. The company said it had installed air monitors at the Sizemore Pad to track VOC and other<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>emissions.</p>

      <p>The families complained that the WVDEP was “not doing its job,” citing the agency’s lack of air monitoring efforts and hourslong response times to odor complaints. The WVDEP air quality inspector told them the agency makes sure EQT follows its permits.

      <p>The volatile compounds released into the hollow by EQT and detected in the urine samples of the families are highly reactive organic solvents, explained Michael McCawley, an inhalation toxicologist and associate professor at West Virginia University. In summer 2022, McCawley visited the hollow and met with the families. “It was very quickly irritating to my lungs and left me with a persistent cough for the rest of the day,” he recalled, but air samples he collected a day later “showed nothing at the<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>time.”</p>

    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>“They’re highly inflammatory agents,” said McCawley, who served as an industrial hygienist for 27 years with the CDC’s National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health. When the chemicals benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene enter the body, each insults human cells and causes an inflammatory reaction. The immune system responds, McCawley said, and “that damage just simply multiplies itself.” It taxes the immune system and with prolonged exposure, the damage can lead to chronic<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>disease.</p>

      <p>“Kick a cell hard enough, long enough, it&#8217;s going to just fail,” McCawley said. “But in the meantime, it&#8217;s not going to work the way it’s supposed to work. … It&#8217;s going to produce<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>symptoms.”</p>

    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>Coughing, rashes and shortness of breath are acute symptoms expected to result from exposure to the VOCs, McCawley said. The common neurological symptoms reported by the three families in the hollow — involuntary twitching, phantom stings and brain fog — could be expected, too, he<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>said.</p>


    <!-- Byline-->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>“It&#8217;s a real complex sort of thing,” McCawley said, “which is why it hides so well.” He said some symptoms are difficult to predict and can “fluctuate enormously” between individuals depending on their vulnerability and level of<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>exposure.</p>

    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>Over a long period of time, chronic neurological diseases, such as dementia, could develop. “We know pretty well that plaque formation in the brain is coming from inflammatory reactions,” he said. He added that plaque could affect blood vessels, too, and lead to heart attacks or strokes. Benzene in particular is known to cause leukemia, a form of cancer affecting blood<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>cells.</p>

      <p>Styrene and phthalates were found in the urine of all members of the Knob Fork families. They are also highly reactive chemicals that would elicit a similar inflammatory reaction, McCawley<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>said.</p>

    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>It didn’t get above 73 degrees. It was cold and windy and the families spent most of their time at the beach house or shopping, but it was a welcome respite from the<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>hollow.</p>

      <p>That first day at the sea, Abby’s breathing was still labored but the ringing in her ears had disappeared, she journaled. By the second day, her voice had returned, free from the squeakiness it often developed at home, and she managed to crawl around in the sand, looking for shells. On the third, she said, “we were getting around like we were our old selves again.” In her journal, she celebrated a journey up stairs, although accompanied by tired lungs. “32 steps!” she<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>wrote.</p>

    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>By day four, the twitching had subsided, and the phantom bee stings had vanished. Later in the week, she tried to kayak with Scott on the sound, but had an anxiety attack and resolved to gather shells along the beach. Piper swam in the pool. “Great day,” Abby<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>wrote.</p>

      <p>The EPA requested technical support from the CDC’s Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry [ATSDR] “to evaluate potential exposures and possible adverse health effects,” according to the agency.

      <p>In July 2022, Melissa Ostroff, a certified optical gas imaging thermographer with the national environmental organization Earthworks, visited Knob Fork. She framed EQT’s Sizemore Pad through the lens of a FLIR GF320, a camera specially calibrated to detect invisible hydrocarbons and volatile<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>gasses.</p>


    <!-- Byline-->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>The high-sensitivity grayscale <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deocgbT-Zug">recording</a> revealed a long, continuous plume steadily flowing from the pad’s vapor destruction unit. The emissions weren’t just heat or steam, Ostroff said, because the temperature matched that of the air and the plume was invisible to the human eye. It floated slowly downwind toward the homes of the Tennants, Hollabaughs and<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>Kennedys.</p>


    <!-- Byline-->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>“This is clearly not normal,” Ostroff recalled in a recent interview. Usually, she finds emissions issues at older facilities, arising from maintenance failures. The Sizemore Pad, though, was built in<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>2021.</p>


    <!-- Byline-->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>Ostroff’s recording and EQT schematics for the Sizemore Pad show that the vapor destruction unit attaches directly to a BTEX tank, which held the VOC byproducts benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene. The destruction unit is designed to burn off the pollutants before they can escape into the surrounding atmosphere. But the plume in Ostroff’s recording suggested otherwise. “If we&#8217;re seeing a lengthy plume, then the combustion is clearly inefficient.<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>…</p>


    <!-- Byline-->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>“What we&#8217;re seeing here are uncombusted VOCs. The BTEX<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>chemicals.”</p>

    <!-- Asterisk divider -->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>After viewing the recording, McCawley, the WVU inhalant toxicologist, said, “It’s not a good scenario. … That&#8217;s exactly the kind of thing that you don&#8217;t want to have happen.<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>…</p>


    <!-- Byline-->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>“If you overdo your system, you need an escape valve to reduce the pressure on the system because you don&#8217;t want to blow pipes out,” he explained. “It’s good engineering, but it&#8217;s not so good for<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>health.”</p>


    <!-- Byline-->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>Eight months later, EPA investigators aimed a FLIR camera at the BTEX tanks and pollution control equipment, finding hydrocarbon emissions “from multiple points.” EQT pledged to conduct<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>repairs.</p>


    <!-- Byline-->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>Emissions released in the valley would tend to accumulate during the night, said Jose Fuentes, an expert in atmospheric chemistry and a professor at Pennsylvania State University. “If there is a source of a gas, then those gasses will remain highly concentrated near the source during the nighttime,” he explained after viewing the<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>recording.</p>


    <!-- Byline-->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>“And so if you have a house or a neighborhood nearby, they would be impacted by<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>this.”</p>

      <p>The night of Oct. 30, 2022, Matt Kennedy used a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSnFSitPicQ">summa canister</a> supplied by <a href="https://earthworks.org/">Earthworks</a> to collect an eight-hour sample of the air at the Tennant’s front porch. The results identified a number of VOCs, including BTEX, and showed concentrations of benzene 40% higher than the eight-hour safe exposure limit set by the Occupational Safety and Health<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>Administration.</p>

      <p>Around two weeks later, the neighbor nearest the pad reported visible emissions and loud noises from the Sizemore’s storage tanks. Abby called upset that afternoon to report black plumes coming off the well<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>pad.</p>


    <!-- Byline-->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>A WVDEP report for the incident noted that the agency contacted EQT, which had found and repaired a “leaking valve to storage tanks, with audible noise and visible release from tank safety relief valve.” Though visible emissions violate the pad’s permits, documents received by PublicSource in a Freedom of Information Act request do not show any enforcement activity by<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>WVDEP.</p>


    <!-- Byline-->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>The next day, on Feb. 22, the nearest neighbor filed another complaint, noting a “horrible smell” that “will take ur breath away and instant headache, having trouble breathing when u go outside.” The neighbor wrote that it was “pointless to call the EQT hotline” because they won’t fix the issue or even call<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>back.</p>


    <!-- Byline-->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>In response, the WVDEP inspector called EQT, which reported all its equipment was operating as permitted and there were no odors nor visible<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>emissions.</p>


    <!-- Byline-->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>The pattern continued into the spring, with Knob Fork residents complaining to the WVDEP, the agency contacting EQT, the company responding that there was nothing wrong, and the agency relaying that message to the<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>residents.</p>


    <!-- Byline-->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>On March 5, the neighbor called again to report an ongoing sulfur odor coming from the well pad. Again, the WVDEP inspector emailed EQT: “Were there any problems/odors at Sizemore yesterday, Sun Mar.<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>5?”</p>

      <p>This past November, Matt Kennedy stood in the log home that he and Dia built in the hollow, on their 87 acres, in 2008. The walls were Alaskan yellow cedar and the beams made of hemlock. It was their dream home, tucked back from the Mountaineer Highway overlooking a pond stocked with koi fish and flanked with a hutch for the ducks that his oldest daughter, Brooklyn, used to care for. “You don’t walk away from it for no reason,&quot; he<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>said.</p>

      <p>The upstairs bedrooms are trimmed with oak harvested from trees on the property. Belongings remain strewn about Brooklyn’s room. “She grabbed what she wanted and just left and has never come back,” Matt remembered. That was two years ago, when the family decided to abandon the log home and move to New<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>Martinsville.</p>

      <p>Matt hasn’t swept or dusted in case a lawyer might one day want to test the home for<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>contamination.</p>

    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>That evening, he drove his side-by-side ATV through the hollow, pausing along the dirt road where only the low drone of the pad could be heard. He pointed along the creek bed, where EQT had placed air<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>monitors.</p>

    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>Matt&#8217;s urine test showed benzene levels 82% higher than the average American. “I&#8217;ve never smoked a cigarette in my life or anything,” he said. “Where&#8217;s that come<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>from?”</p>

    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>His health concerns weren&#8217;t as severe as those of Dia and Abby or his girls, who stayed home more when they lived in Knob Fork. “Brain fog every now and then, my words get mixed up,” he said. He had the chest pains and the headaches,<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>too.</p>

      <p>He parked the four-wheeler in the tall grass at the top of the<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>hill.</p>

    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>“We&#8217;re out in the middle of<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>nowhere!”</p>


    <!-- Byline-->
    



    <!-- Story text -->
    
      <p>When he cut the engine, all that could be heard was the sound of the grass rustling in the breeze and the compressor station&#8217;s vacuum-like<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>hum.</p>

      <p>EQT owned the mineral rights beneath his land, allowing the company to suck up the gas below, for a price. Without the money from that lease, he said, the family would never have been able to afford the house in New Martinsville. The irony didn’t escape<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>him.</p>
